	BRAIN TUMOUR DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING


In recent decades, human brain tumor detection has become one of the most challenging issues in medical science. In this project, we propose a magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) images as an input & determines whether tumor is present or not.

Libraries and framework used in this project are TensorFlow, Keras, numpy , pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn.
Integrated development environment(IDE) that supports python, such as jupyter notebook, pycharm and visual studio code.
Run on any operating system that supports python such as windows, Mac OS, and linux.
